# RecipeScaler
Scales recipes read from a web URL and displays instructions without the obnoxious popups and ads on most websites.

This will be built with a common backend (ASP.NET Core Web API) and 2 front ends (Blazor WebAssembly and React).

Enjoy amkng as much or as little of a recipe as you want and feel the freedom of not being encumbered by massive amounts of scrolling and mind numbing ads.

This software is unlicensed and free to all forever and always.  It is my contribution to ending world hunger.  Eat, Drink, Code, and Be Merry.
